HTML & CSS| Lesson 3 
Practice: Profile Page for Portfolio 
Instructions 
For this practice, you’ll be creating a profile page for your portfolio. You’ll plan your 
profile page, create the HTML structure, and write an external CSS file. You’ll use 
everything you’ve learned so far about HTML & CSS in order to create your page. 
Tasks 
Step 1: Plan Your Profile Page 
Think about how you want your profile page to look and what content to include. 
The page should contain: 
1. A Header: Includes your name and a brief tagline (e.g., "Aspiring Web 
Developer"). 
2. A Section with a Profile Picture and About Me Text: Use a placeholder 
image or a real one. 
3. A Skills List: Include at least 3 skills presented in a list (ordered or 
unordered). 
4. A Footer: Add any additional information, such as a copyright message or a 
link to your GitHub profile. 
Step 2: Create the HTML Structure 
In your HTML file: 
1. Write semantic HTML using tags like <header>, <section>, <ul>/<ol>, and 
<footer>. 
2. Ensure your content is well-organized with meaningful IDs or classes for 
styling.

Step 3: Write the External CSS File 
Create a separate CSS file to style your HTML: 
1. Link the CSS File: Use the <link> tag in the <head> section of your HTML file 
to connect the CSS. 
2. Add CSS Rules: Style the elements in your HTML file using element selectors, 
class selectors, and ID selectors. Focus on: 
○ Setting background colors. 
○ Adjusting text alignment, colors, and fonts. 
○ Adding spacing and padding to elements. 
Step 4: Test and Iterate 
1. Open the HTML file in your browser to see the styling applied. 
2. Adjust the CSS rules as needed to achieve the desired look.
