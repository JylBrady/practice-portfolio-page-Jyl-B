Practice: Portfolio Page
Instructions 

You will create a static HTML portfolio page that includes various HTML tags, a 
contact form, and a table showcasing your skills or experience. This activity will help 
you practice structuring content, incorporating forms, and organizing data with 
tables. 

Tasks:
    Step 1: Plan the Portfolio Page 
        Before coding, students will plan the structure of their portfolio page. 
        The page should include: 
        1. A Header: Contains the name and a brief tagline. 
        2. An "About Me" Section: Includes a paragraph about themselves. 
        3. A Skills Table: Displays a list of skills or tools with proficiency levels in a table format. 
        4. A Contact Form: Allows visitors to send a message, including fields for the visitor's name, email, and message. 

    Step 2: Create the HTML Structure 
        1. Use semantic tags like <header>, <section>, and <footer> to organize the page. 
        2. Create a table with appropriate headers (<th>), rows (<tr>), and cells (<td>). 
        3. Add a form with labels, input fields, and a submit button. The form should use:
                ○ type="text" for the name field. 
                ○ type="email" for the email field. 
                ○ <textarea> for the message field. 
        4. Use other relevant tags, such as <h1>, <p>, <ul>, or <img>, to enhance the design. 

    Step 3: Test and Review 
    Once the page is complete, you should: 
        1. Test the form to ensure all fields are correctly labeled. 
        2. Check the table for proper alignment and formatting. 
        3. Review the code to ensure proper use of tags and attributes. 
                Example Structure 
                ● Header 
                ● About Me Section 
                ● Skills Table 
                ● Contact Form  -->
