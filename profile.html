<!--  HTML & CSS| Lesson 3 
Practice: Profile Page for Portfolio 

Instructions 
    For this practice, you’ll be creating a profile page for your portfolio. You’ll plan your 
    profile page, create the HTML structure, and write an external CSS file. You’ll use 
    everything you’ve learned so far about HTML & CSS in order to create your page. 
Tasks 
    Step 1: Plan Your Profile Page 
            Think about how you want your profile page to look and what content to include. 
            The page should contain: 
                1. A Header: Includes your name and a brief tagline 
                2. A Section with a Profile Picture and About Me Text: Use a placeholder image or a real one. 
                3. A Skills List: Include at least 3 skills presented in a list (ordered or unordered). 
                4. A Footer: Add any additional information, such as a copyright message or a link to your GitHub profile. 
    Step 2: Create the HTML Structure 
            In your HTML file: 
                1. Write semantic HTML using tags like <header>, <section>, <ul>/<ol>, and <footer>. 
                2. Ensure your content is well-organized with meaningful IDs or classes for styling. 
    Step 3: Write the External CSS File 
            Create a separate CSS file to style your HTML: 
                1. Link the CSS File: Use the <link> tag in the <head> section of your HTML file to connect the CSS. 
                2. Add CSS Rules: Style the elements in your HTML file using element selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors. Focus on: 
                    ○ Setting background colors. 
                    ○ Adjusting text alignment, colors, and fonts. 
                    ○ Adding spacing and padding to elements. 
    Step 4: Test and Iterate 
            1. Open the HTML file in your browser to see the styling applied. 
            2. Adjust the CSS rules as needed to achieve the desired look. -->
